# A systematic analysis to perform robust Glioblastoma subtypes deconvolution from single cell data towards extracting prognostic biomarkers for clinical associations
BIOINF 590 project by Mahnoor Naseer Gondal, Behnoush Rostami, Christa Ventresca

In this study, we develop a unified model of glioblastoma cell states and genetic diversity using single-cell RNA-sequencing as well as bulk genetic expression analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). As glioblastoma has four subtypes, this study identifies the malignant cells within the three subtypes and makes use of TCGA data on these subtypes towards identifying putative biomarkers its treatment. Our goal is to analyze the single cell data to find features that can be mapped back to bulk data for glioblastoma robust lassification.

The outline of the study can be found below:
